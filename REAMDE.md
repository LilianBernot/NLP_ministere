# Project description (English)

This project is from a NLP class I am taking at Mines Paris. It is done in collaboration with the "*data studio* de la direction de la prévention des risques du Ministère de la transition écologique, de la biodiversité, de la forêt, de la mer et de la pêche".

## Quick look up

The first goal of the project is to find articles that modify the other ones. 
The second goal, which is given as a different project, is to classify these modifications and explain how 
To do so, I first looked manually at the articles to find different information that could proof helpful. 

For my research, I created two documents : 
- ```Investigations.md``` : basically a rough draft of what I am looking at.
- ```Examples.md``` : a file where I store the raw html elements I find relevant to study.

And created two folders : 
- ```parsing``` : relative to the project n°2. It aims at parsing the raw html files to retrieve the mentions of articles.
- ```classification``` : relative to the project n°3. It aims at studying the output of the parser to classify the mentions.

## Language

The project is being done for a French entity, studying French texts. So the next parts of notes will mostly be written in French. Maybe some English will still appear in the documentation, mostly things that are really code-related.
