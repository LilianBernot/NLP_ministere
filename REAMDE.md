# Project description

This project is from a NLP class I am taking at Mines Paris. It is done in collaboration with the *data studio* de la direction de la prévention des risques du Ministère de la transition écologique, de la biodiversité, de la forêt, de la mer et de la pêche.

# Quick look up

The first goal of the project is to find articles that modify the other ones. To do so, I am first looking manually at the articles to find different information that could proof helpful. 

I created two documents : 
- Investigations.md : basically a rough draft of what I am looking at, what I dind.
- Examples.md : a file where I store the raw html elements I find relevant to study.
